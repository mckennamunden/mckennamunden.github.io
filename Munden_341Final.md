#Final Website Overview Paper

##Overview

When I heard the final project for Web Development 341 was to create a professional website, I was ecstatic but also incredible nervous. Coming into this class I had very minimal knowledge of anything html (other than the few things I picked up from youtube years ago when I first started a blogspot blog and found ways to add widgets with html). There was a lot of information covered within the course but I surprised myself with how much of it I actually retained. I wanted to create a portfolio website for my photography that really highlighted my best work and what I generally photograph. I loved my current existing website but had been meaning to try a much simpler design and this was the perfect opportunity to try that out. I wanted to create an aesthetically pleasing website that would catch potential clients' eyes and show them a variety of styles I photograph without the amount of information being too overwhelming. 

##Related Work

I am very influenced and inspired by many things. When deciding how simple I wanted my website, I was inspired by Sami Huerta’s website (http://www.simplysami.co/). I knew I wanted to create something simple like hers but perhaps even more minimal (less words perhaps). As far as artists that inspire me goes, it is hard to narrow down specific individuals as I feel I am always being influenced and inspired by someone new. Currently I am obsessed with the works of both Bethany Marie (http://www.bethanymarie.co/) and Jaci Marie Smith (http://www.jacimarie.com/). Their photography, style and even their websites are some of my current favorites. I wanted to base my own website off of a mix of all three of these styles. Luckily, after hours of searching, I found a free template that I knew I could customize to meet my needs. It gave me the options to create a super simple yet intriguing site with a single themed look.

##Site Description

This site is a portfolio for my personal / freelance photography business. With it, I intended to capture the eyes of potential clients who are looking for a welcoming photographer with an eye for detail. I created a color scheme that matched the neutral tones of my featured photos. This would not only bring out the colors of my photographs but it would also serve as a non-distractive simple basis for the rest of the information of the site. I love straight, clean lines and so I knew I wanted to stay away from too many curved / rounded edges. The photos I selected were each picked for their excellent representation of my work, color themes and clarity. I created the galleries to be as similar to the home page as possible in order to keep a consistent feel across the entire website. The Desktop version has hovering details and wider grids for the content while the mobile version of my site is more compact yet still simple. My site is responsive and made with mobile-first design principles.

##Development Process

My developing process began with a bunch of different little ideas in my head that I tried to accomplish all on my own and on the same site. This, of course, ended up being too messy and proving to be quite difficult with the little knowledge I had (and the big plans I had for my site). I spent hours after that searching for a free template that was my style and aesthetic, easily customizable and would allow me to showcase my wok the way I wanted. I ended up finding one amongst the chaos that was all of those things. It originally contained an odd color scheme and many little elements that crowded the simplistic feel I was going for. It took some searching among the crazy amount of html provided but I ended up finding what I needed and customizing it to fit my style. This had to be the most difficult portion of creative the site because it forced me use my basic knowledge to earth the paragraphs and paragraphs of code for a single element (the I either wanted to keep, customize or get rid of). Eventually though I found nearly everything I was looking for and my site was looking nearly finished already. Besides these problems, occasionally a photo that worked in the template a few minutes ago wouldn’t work a few minutes late. I never did figure out why this was happening but managed to play around with different pictures to see what fit best. I also couldn’t figure out how to turn off the grey that appeared over the photos when hovered over. Besides these few difficulties though , I was very successful in the design and execution of creating my portfolio site.

##Future Work

In the future I would add more of my work to the site along with perhaps a small blog as it would let potential clients see and hear a little bit of my personal voice and “get to know me” better. I do not see myself maintaining this particular site as I do not feel I am qualified enough when it comes to code and executing the ideas in my head. For now, my original website using Squarespace is perfect for me and allows me to customize my site with ease.

##Conclusion 

Overall I did have a lot of fun with this project. Creating something like this website was one of the reasons I joined the class in the first place and I impressed myself with what I was able to take out of one simple, short semester. While the project had its ups and downs, it really helped solidify what I learned in 341 WebDev and show me just what I could do with coding AND my own imagination.
