               <h3><center>About Me</center></h3>
                    <p>I started taking pictures at a very very young age but didn't get in to portrait photography until my sophomore year in high school when I started off taking a few senior photos of my friends. Before that, I was mainly a conceptual photographer and just took pictures of myself. Today, I have started my own photography business and begun my own blog. I have worked with numerous clients which recently include Old Navy and People.com.</p>
