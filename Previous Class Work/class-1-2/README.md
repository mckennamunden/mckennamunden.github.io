# Homework Week 1.2

It took me a little while to figure out this homework as I am still trying to get with the lingo. Yet, I can feel things starting to click. And after review in class on September 6th I am really starting to get confident with these basics. I am excited to be able to do more with my poem than what I submited today because it does look really really bland and boring as of now!
