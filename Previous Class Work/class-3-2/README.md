# Homework Week 3.2

I took an extra long time on this assignment because I wanted to make sure I TRULY 
understood what I was doing. And I actually surprised myself with how much I actually remembered.

Even so, I had a hard time remembering how to correctly enter the div, id, and some meta elements. 
I hope some quick clarifications in class today will help me get through that easily and I can add them in quickly 
to whatever I missed.

UPDATE:
Alright, like I expected, a refresher on these little things was all I needed and they were very easy to add in.
