            <p>I first expirimented with the Rey hairstyle during the Halloween of 2015. Keep in mind that this was before the movie even premiered so the only references I had were the few previews and pictures floating around the internet. I even designed an entire Rey costume on these few short seconds of preview and pictures. I was a fan of this character before I had even seen her on the big screen!</p>
