# First Draft Mobile Home Page

I spent HOURS trying to figure out this slideshow without using javascript. 
And after the first couple of hours I tried to teach myself javascript yet ran into many bumps 
and decided to continue my search for a simple CSS and HTML slideshow. I eventually did find some 
codes and tweaked them slightly to fit better with what I wanted. Even so, I could not get my 
slideshow to be responsive no matter how much I tried - so I still need help in this. I would also
like to span the slideshow across the entire width of the home page but couldn't figure this out other.

Other than this, my website is coming along nicely and I am really enjoying this creative freedom.
