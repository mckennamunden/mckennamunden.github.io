# Second Draft Website Using A Framework

This website is actually turning out really really well. 
Using a framework makes everything so much easier and allows me to focus
on the smaller things sooner. 

I am still working on adding all of the photos to the website and creating the individual 
"portfolio" pages. I am also still working on getting more of the social links and icons added
instead of just the Twitter and occasional Facebook. I also need to add the appropriate links to these.

Still some styling things I want to work on, but overall I am already super proud.

Loving this creative freedom - its really good for me right now.
