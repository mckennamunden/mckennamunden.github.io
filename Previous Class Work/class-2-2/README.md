# Homework Week 2.2

There was a lot of information for this homework and I am ALMOST up to speed with all of it. 
I am having trouble with the adding the images. I just cannot seem to get the picture link right. 
I also do not remember how to check the dimensions of the picture, so I couldn't add those either.
And lastly, I couldn't remember how to add a second page with a relative link to it from the first.

I am hoping just a little bit of review in class will help me remember and I can finish this assignment 100%.

UPDATE:
My picture problem was just a simple mistake in not pushing the pictures to the directory/naming the files correctly. I am feeling much much better about all of this already. I also figured out the relative link pretty fast once I relized I had to upload a different html page to the directory and link to THAT. For whatever reason when that was first explained, I was very confused and didn't understand that.

Even though it is taking me longer to get all this stuff, I am really getting so much more confident in all of these areas. Yay!
