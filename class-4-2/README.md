# Homework Week 4.2

I had a lot of trouble with this assignment and the super long list of requirements made 
the assignment that much more daunting. I'm still not 100% positive I met all of the 
requirements and will have to go through and double check them. I also had trouble with 
the downloaded font from font squirrel and adding that to my website.

This was a big bite of CSS to bite off at once for me.
