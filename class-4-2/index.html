               <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>I started taking pictures at a very very young age but didn't get in to portrait photography until my sophomore year in high school when I started off taking a few senior photos of my friends. Before that, I was mainly a conceptual photographer and just took pictures of myself. Today, I have started my own photography business and begun my own blog</p>
