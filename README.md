#Final Draft Website

My final project for Web Development 341 was to build a professional website. I used the Bootstrap Framework and free template 
I found to create my own personal photography portfolio website.

The template I found originally came with many gadgets and overall made the website look very jumbled and messy. By taking out many of these excess elements, changing the color scheme to something far more neutral and adding my own personal touches, I was able to create a simple and aesthetically pleasing site that highlighted my work and me.

All images used in my site are my own. I selected just a few of my favorite pieces in order to keep the look of the website clean and fit well with the template.


(exact name of creators and location of free template my site is based on could not be found/remembered at this time - I apologize for the inconvenience)
